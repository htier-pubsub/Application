How to compile the above c file in my laptop, CAn I use tht makefile

yes, you can use the Makefile to compile your C code! Here's how to do it step by step:

Prerequisites
First, you'll need to install the required dependencies. The Makefile includes a handy target to check for them:

make check-deps

If dependencies are missing, install them based on your operating system:

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libcjson-dev build-essential
On CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:

# Fedora
sudo dnf install libcurl-devel libcjson-devel gcc make
# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install libcurl-devel libcjson-devel gcc make
On macOS:

# Install Homebrew if you don't have it
brew install curl cjson
Missing Configuration File
Your C code includes "../config_parameters.h", but this file isn't provided. You'll need to create it. Based on the code, it should define:

// config_parameters.h
#ifndef CONFIG_PARAMETERS_H
#define CONFIG_PARAMETERS_H
#define RUST_SERVER_URL "http://localhost:8080"  // Adjust as needed
#define HTTP_TIMEOUT 30L                         // Timeout in seconds
#define SLEEP_TIME 5                             // Sleep time in seconds
#define REG_NB 10                                // Number of registers
#endif
Compilation Steps
Place files correctly:

Put main.c in your working directory
Put Makefile in the same directory
Create config_parameters.h in the parent directory (or adjust the include path)
Compile using the Makefile:

make
Or explicitly:

make all
Check for successful compilation:
If successful, you'll have an executable named c_bridge

Running the Program
./c_bridge
Note: The program expects a Rust server to be running at the configured URL. Make sure your Rust server is running first, or the program will exit with an error.

Additional Makefile Targets
make clean - Remove compiled files
make help - Show available targets
make check-deps - Verify dependencies are installed
Let me know if you encounter any compilation errors and I can help troubleshoot!

2) When I type make in the files directory, it throws the exception that make is not recognized command


I can see from the screenshot that you're on Windows and getting the error "'make' is not recognized as an internal or external command". This is because make is not installed by default on Windows.

Here are several solutions to compile your C code on Windows:

Option 1: Install Make for Windows
Using Chocolatey (Recommended):

Install Chocolatey if you haven't: https://chocolatey.org/install
Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:
choco install make
Using MSYS2:

Download and install MSYS2: https://www.msys2.org/
Open MSYS2 terminal and install make:
pacman -S make gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-curl mingw-w64-x86_64-cjson
Option 2: Use Visual Studio Build Tools
If you have Visual Studio installed, you can compile directly with cl.exe:

cl /I.. main.c /link libcurl.lib cjson.lib
Option 3: Compile Manually with GCC (if installed)
If you have MinGW or GCC installed:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -O2 -I.. -o c_bridge main.c -lcurl -lcjson
Option 4: Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
Install WSL2 with Ubuntu
Install dependencies in Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev libcjson-dev
Then use the Makefile as intended:
make
Quick Fix for Right Now
The easiest immediate solution is probably Option 1 with Chocolatey or Option 4 with WSL if you want to use the existing Makefile without modifications.

Which option would you prefer to try first?

If you just want to compile your C file quickly (ignoring the Makefile), you can absolutely do it manually using a compiler like GCC or Clang — but this only works well if the project is simple (one or two C files, no complicated build steps).

If you just want to compile your C file *quickly* (ignoring the Makefile), you can absolutely do it manually using a compiler like GCC or Clang — but this only works well if the project is simple (one or two C files, no complicated build steps).

## **Manual Compilation Without `make`**

1. **Install a C compiler** (if not already installed):

   * **MinGW-w64** (recommended for Windows): [https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/)
   * Or **TDM-GCC**: [https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/)

2. **Add GCC to PATH** (so `gcc` works in any folder):

   * Locate your compiler’s `bin` folder, e.g.:

     ```
     C:\mingw-w64\bin
     ```
   * Add it to your environment variables PATH in Windows.
   * Verify with:

     ```cmd
     gcc --version
     ```

3. **Compile your file manually**
   Navigate to your C file folder in Command Prompt:

   ```cmd
   cd C:\path\to\your\project
   gcc yourfile.c -o yourprogram.exe
   ```

   If there are multiple source files:

   ```cmd
   gcc file1.c file2.c -o program.exe
   ```

   Then run it:

   ```cmd
   program.exe
   ```

## **Why you might still need `make`**

* If your project has **many source files** or **custom build options**, the Makefile automates all of this.
* Recompiling manually each time will be tedious if there are a lot of files.

**Do you want me to:**

1. **Give you a step-by-step guide to install `make` on Windows and use your existing Makefile?** (best if project is big)
2. **Write the manual GCC commands for your specific files** (fast if it’s just one or two files)?
